### About
### It is with a hard feeling in our heart, that we have to announce, that Pamaxie as a project is cancelled. Due to lacking funds and massive changes in the project owners life (Leejja) we currently no longer have the financial or time capacity to maintain it which is why we think it is best that we close this chapter of our life. We are sorry that we could not live up to our promises. We are looking into a cheap way to host our dataset. If possible we may update this page. Due to concerns for the public we might not however (there is some graphic imagry in there which may be quite disturbing or problematic to release)
This is our scanning client allowing for content to be scanned and the scan result to be returned to our [scanning api](https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie.Scan_API). We are planning to allow users to utelize this client in the future to scan their own content too.

You can contribute to this project, primarily by improving our performance of machine learning and machine type detection. Since we support a number of machine types (including GPU, CPU as well as TPU architectures), we would love some help on how to keep training results quick and snappy.
Our training algorithms sadly not publically available for now, this is for security reasons. We might end up publicizing them in the future however.

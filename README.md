### About
This is our scanning client allowing for content to be scanned and the scan result to be returned to our [scanning api](https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie.Scan_API). We are planning to allow users to utelize this client in the future to scan their own content too.

### Contribution
You can contribute to this project, primarily by improving our performance of machine learning and machine type detection. Since we support a number of machine types (including GPU, CPU as well as TPU architectures), we would love some help on how to keep training results quick and snappy.
Our training algorithms sadly not publically available for now, this is for security reasons. We might end up publicizing them in the future however.
